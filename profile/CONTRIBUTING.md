# Contributing to the Digital Health Section Code Repros

## Code of conduct

We expect contributors to act professionally and respectfully; contributors are expected to maintain the safety and dignity of the social environment on GitHub. 

Specifically:

* Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
* Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
* Listen. Consider and acknowledge people's points before responding.



## Documentation

If and when you contribute code to a repository - be it your own or others - please make sure that it is well-documented. This entails:

* Write a thorough and programmer-friendly README for each repro.
* Write proper API documentation for your code (see below).
* Create additional markdown (`.md`) files or wiki pages that explains and documents how to use your code
* Provide example code to get people started.

As an example, take a look at the [CARP Core Kotlin](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.core-kotlin) repository, which provides exemplary documentation and works as an example of the level of documentation expected.

* **Python** - please follow the "[Documenting Python Code: A Complete Guide](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/)" guidelines.
