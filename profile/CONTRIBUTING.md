# Contributing to the Digital Health Section Code Repositories

## Code of conduct

We expect contributors to act professionally and respectfully; contributors are expected to maintain the safety and dignity of the social environment on GitHub. 

Specifically:

* Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
* Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
* Listen. Consider and acknowledge people's points before responding.

## What Code should be added?

This site hosts code repositories made by researchers and students affiliated with the Digital Health Section at DTU Health Tech. In Denmark, the Intellectual Property Right (IPR) legislation works differently whether you're a student or an employee at DTU.

* As a student, you own the IPR of your work, including the copyright to any code you write.
* As an employee - including PhD students and Research Assistants - DTU owns the IPR and has the copyright to your code.

Thus, adding code to this organization differs in the two cases.

### Student

As a student, you can decide to hand over the code to DTU and add it to this GitHub site. This is something you decide in collaboration with your supervisor and can happen if, for example, you continue some prior work based at DTU, if you want future students to continue working on your project, or if your code is part of a bigger set of projects at DTU. If you wish to transfer the ownership of your code to DTU, you and your supervisor should:

* Sign the so-called "G Declaration".
* Create and use a code repository in this GitHub organization (or transfer the repository from another GitHub account, like your own).
* Make sure that your code is documented correctly (see below)



## Documentation

If and when you contribute code to a repository - be it your own or others - please ensure it is well-documented. This entails:

* Write a thorough and programmer-friendly README for each repository.
* Write proper API documentation for your code (see below).
* Create additional markdown (`.md`) files or wiki pages that explain and document how to use your code
* Provide example code to get people started.

For example, look at the [CARP Core Kotlin](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.core-kotlin) repository, which provides exemplary documentation and works as an example of the level of documentation expected.

### API Documentation

Depending on your programming language, there are the following API documentation guides to follow:

* **Python** - please follow the "[Documenting Python Code: A Complete Guide](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/)" guidelines.
* **Dart/Flutter** - please follow the "[Effective Dart: Documentation](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/documentation#doc-comments)" guidelines.
